## ⚙ Usage
To use the support chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Specify whether you want to book a `Hotel` or a `Car`. The chatbot has only these 2 intents.**
2. **Afterwards, you'll be asked to specify the `Location`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Age`, `Room Type` or `Car Type`.**
3. **Try to answer question with a single or few words (keep it simple). Otherwise, the chatbot will initiate it's fallback intent and end the call**.
4. **You can also perform a `Voice Call` with the chatbot, but ensure your voice is clear.**

Lastly, this was a fun project 🎉! Feel free to play around with it, but expect things to break if you play too hard 🤣.
